                    <li class="wordy-list">We have established goals at each age level that are developmentally
                        appropriate and designed to prepare the child for kindergarten experiences. We have made a
                        special effort to coordinate our goals with the GA Early Learning Standards (GELDS).</li>
                    <li class="wordy-list">We believe in learning through play. We structure our activities to be
                        directed learning that is fun for the students. Children play in centers, have short group
                        activities, read lots of stories, learn songs and finger-plays, have snack, & play outside.</li>
                    <li class="wordy-list">All our children spend 20-50 minutes each week with our music teacher. Our
                        4’s spend a special time each month with our art teacher and attend Math Camp each month. Three
                        and fours have Spanish each week and a special Science Lab experience each month.</li>
                    <li class="wordy-list">Our activities are experienced based and hands-on. Each child completes a
                        fun project every day with the teacher that focuses on learning goals.</li>
                    <li class="wordy-list">Extended day is available from 12 – 1:00 for 2’s and young 2’s when they are
                        mature enough to enjoy a longer day. Parents are billed $5 for each day their child attends.
                        Parents of 2's may also elect to have a 9 - 1:00 schedule every day and pay the $180 rate for 2
                        days. Students in the 3’s and 4’s classes stay until 1:00 everyday. Students bring a lunch from

                                Most students in these classes turn two during the summer or fall. Students
                                must be walking
